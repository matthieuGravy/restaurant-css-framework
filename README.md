## Bootstrap-Powered Web Development Project with Custom Functionalities

This BeCode project, initially perceived as a quick task, aimed to create five web pages using the Bootstrap framework while integrating specific functionalities into each page. The basic approach involved leveraging Bootstrap's pre-built components and styles to expedite the development process while delivering aesthetically pleasing results.

The five pages created as part of this project could include elements such as interactive forms, responsive navigation bars, blog sections, image galleries, or any other relevant content based on project requirements.

While building the pages using Bootstrap can simplify layout and responsive design management, integrating custom functionalities on each page, such as JavaScript scripts for DOM manipulation, user interaction, or form validation, might require special attention to ensure smooth operation.

Ultimately, this BeCode project provided an opportunity to learn and apply web development skills, using Bootstrap as a foundation for web page design while customizing these pages with specific functionalities to meet project needs.

Throughout the project, the following supplementary guidelines were given:

- Implement a responsive form with conditional logic.
- Prioritize speed and efficiency in both the development and deployment phases.
- Incorporate a cookie banner.
- Create a realistic menu with allergen information or descriptions.
- Employ a custom map feature.
- Utilize Dribbble for reference or inspiration.
- Ensure no broken links within the project.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Proactive Approach:** I learned the importance of being proactive. At the beginning of the project, I invested a significant amount of time trying to set up Bootstrap cleanly and searching through the documentation for answers. While this initially seemed like a detour, it ended up being beneficial as I was able to help others with similar issues. Most importantly, this early effort paid off, as I didn't face any major setbacks during the deployment phase, which had initially seemed daunting. Running multiple tests beforehand really eased the finalization process, creating a sense of calm and positivity.
2. **Adapting to Additional Requests:** Initially, I thought I had completed the project after the first couple of days, but additional requests and requirements kept cropping up. This forced me to rethink and adjust my project plan. I faced a challenge in finding the right design layout that I wanted to deliver, which took up a significant amount of time.
3. **Continuous Improvement:** I realized that there's always room for modification and improvement. To manage this, I used tools like Trello to prioritize and keep track of the most important changes. This helped me maintain a clear overview and stay organized throughout the project.
4. **User-Friendly Design:** I understood the importance of using buttons and links effectively to make the project more user-friendly and enjoyable to interact with. A well-designed user interface can greatly enhance the overall user experience.

## Do I plan to continue the development of this project?

No, I could have sped up the tasks by using a JavaScript framework to reuse a jumbotron or iterate the menu. Using HTML slowed down my productivity with these tools. The process was quite lengthy because each time an error occurred, I had to perform detailed checks one by one.
